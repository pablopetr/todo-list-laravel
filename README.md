# TodoList

Todo list built with PHP and Laravel to management of daily tasks and rewards.

## Motivation

I was having some big problems with tasks and rewards wasting most time organizating these tasks in papers. This web application was built to solve this problem with simple solution and to train my skills with PHP and to improve my understand of CRUD and RESTFul API

## Functionalities

1. List tasks of today. We can see all tasks of today, with title, description and date. The controls check, edit, and delete help us to interact with the task.
2. Checked tasks. All tasks already done go to "checked task" and you can see all of this tasks of all days, interacting with the tasks with the RESTful API function.
3. Unchecked tasks. When we don't start or don't done a task, it are unchecked, then we can list all of the tasks of all days.
4. Notes. You can add notes to remember something, about the tasks or something to improve your job.
5. Rewards. When you add a task you need to define a reward, then when you finish this task you gain this reward to motivate your efforts.
6. Time worked by date. The system provides you a control of how many time you worked today, yesterday or any date that you had tasks registered.
